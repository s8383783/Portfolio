I decided to learn software development because of its bright future and I found it very intriguing. Coding requires a lot of technical knowledge and is something that keeps me engaged mentally. I hope to use this skill in a remote position servicing clients. My previous experience of being an analyst will definitely help with this new career.Â I am detail orientated and I love to think critically.",
